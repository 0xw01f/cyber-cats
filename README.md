# About cyber cats 🐱‍💻
The future of cats already exists, an intercatlactical traveller who's commonly known as 'Pawfinder' gave me some **high** confidential information about his future. His mission ended there, because his paws are unfortunately not made for coding.
Now these information are in my own hands, and my job is to share you what he found.
Hang on ! Because your knowledge is nothing concerning this future. ✨
